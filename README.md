## Introduction

Purpose of this tool is to provide dynamic visualization of various examinations of Go packages like exploring $GOPATH, viewing dependencies of package or call graph of a program.

### How it works

It has web server that serves the API and web application that uses [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) for visualization inside `<canvas>`.

- [x] explore hierarchy of $GOPATH
- [ ] view dependencies of a package
- [ ] show call graph of a program
