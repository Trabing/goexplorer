**Go Explorer** is an experimental tool to dynamically visualize Go packages using interactive overview.

## Introduction

Purpose of this project is to experiment with visualization of Go packages to aid developers by providing interactive overviews for various analyses, such as exploring package hierarchy, viewing package dependencies, examining call graph of a program, ..etc.

> The initial idea began during development of [go-callvis](https://github.com/TrueFurby/go-callvis#roadmap), but I've decided to develop *goexplorer* as a separate project, because name *go-callvis* didn't fit.

### How it works

It has web server that serves the API and web application that uses [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) for visualization inside `<canvas>`.

## Features

**This project is currently at very early stage of development!** :warning:

- [x] explore hierarchy of $GOPATH
- [ ] view dependencies of a package
- [ ] examine call graph of a program
